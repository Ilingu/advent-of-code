# Advent of Code::Personal Solution

Welcome on my **personal** advent of code solution repo, here you'll found for each years all (or not) my solutions to the different problems. I think I'll mainly use rust, even though I won't stop myself from using other langages _(Go/TS maybe? or completly new langage)_

⚠ **WORK IN PROGRESS**, advent of code is a good way to learn how to solve problems and I like it, but some problems are quite complex and require a good amount of time to solve it (for me), thus I'll only do this from time to time to keep enjoying it.

Below is a list of the different years.

| Years | Path            | Obtained star ⭐ |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 2022  | [/2022](/2022/) | 43/50            |
