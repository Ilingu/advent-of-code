# Advent of Code::Personal Solution

Welcome to my **personal** advent of code solution repo, here you'll find for each years (or not) all (or not) my solutions to the differents aoc problems. I think I'll mainly use rust, even though I won't stop myself from using other langages _(Go/TS maybe? or completly new langage)_

⚠ **WORK IN PROGRESS**, advent of code is a good way to learn how to solve problems and I like it, but some problems are quite complex and require a good amount of time to solve it (for me), thus I'll only do this from time to time to keep enjoying it.

Below is a list of the different years.

| Years | Path            | Obtained star ⭐                              |
