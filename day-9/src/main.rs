My first approach of this problem was to move the tail to each last position of the head whenever they was a delta > 1 between the head and the tail, that worked very well with a under 30 lines of code, I was pround... until part 2 that introduced new movements... so day-9 was for me a complete rewrite because of my lasiness... ðŸ˜­
